### 9/29/25:
* First thing I did was download Godot and import it into github. I did this by creating a new project on Godot then using Github desktop to add the project folder into a new repository and published it to github. Then I cloned the Godot repo into my Freedom Project folder in my IDE. I watch the video ["Godot 4 - How to use GitHub in less than 3 mins"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qT8ut3EaIpM&t=4s) by CTG on Youtube to do this.
